# Nex

Nex is a simple platform that allows students from the same school to 
find projects to work on and share their ideas.

The whole idea is for students to collaborate on projects and learn from each other. 
It is also meant to build a community amongst your peers and alumnus. 

## Roadmap
- [x] Authentication with Google
- [ ] Authentication with e-mail
  - As of now, for testing purposes, allow any e-mail but in the future it will be restricted to the school's domain along with email verification. 
- [ ] User's Page
- [ ] Project Page
  - [ ] Project CRUD
- [ ] Tests!!!
